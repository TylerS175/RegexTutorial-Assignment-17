# Regex Tutorial - Understanding the Concept - Hex Value /^#?([a-f0-9]{6}|[a-f0-9]{3})$/

Regular expressions are patterns that are used to match character combinations in strings. Regular expression is a composed of simple characters for an example /abc/ or a combination of simple and special characters such as /ab*c/ or /Chapter /d/d/d. Another way of using Regex In a regular expression the metacharacter ^ means "not". So, while "a" means "match lowercase a", "^a" means "do not match lowercase a".

## Summary

In this summary, we are going to be reviewing the components of regular expression that are used to match Hex Values.  Hexadecimal code is a system by which any specific color can be described accurately to a computer, ensuring consistency and accuracy in an electronic display. A hexadecimal color value is a six-digit code preceded by a # sign; it defines a color that is used in a website or a computer program. /^#?([a-f0-9]{6}|[a-f0-9]{3})$/

## Regex Components

### Anchors
Anchors - ^ & $
- Regular Expression anhcors that allow you to match a position before and after characters. Example ^ is a caret anchor matches the beginning of the text while the $ is the dollar anchor that matches the end of the text. If you were applied ^A to ABC matches A. Now using ^B does not match at all because it cannot be match right after the start of the string. Now using $ matches right after the last character in the string. Example C$ would match C in ABC scenario, while if you were use A$ or B$ it does not match at all.
